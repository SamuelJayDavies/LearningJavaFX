      <TextArea id="helpBox" editable="false" layoutX="12.0" layoutY="119.0" prefHeight="388.0" prefWidth="833.0" text="Shed is a card game where the aim is to play all of your cards before the other player can. Cards are played onto the discard pile&#10;and drawn from the draw pile. For a card to be suitable it needs to be greater than or equal to the value of the card in the discard pile.&#10;If the player has no eligible cards, they will pick up all the cards in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 hands of cards at their disposal:&#10;&#10;- General Hand&#10;- Constrained Hand&#10;- Hidden Hand&#10;&#10;The general hand are the cards in the players hand's. All of these cards need to be played to allow access to the constrained hand.&#10;When the discard pile is picked up, all those cards are placed into the general hand.&#10;&#10;The constrained hand are cards that sit on top of the hidden hand. These cards can't be played until the general hand is empty. Once all of&#10;these cards have been played, the player now has access to the hidden hand.&#10;&#10;The cards in the hidden hand are facing down where the values of the cards can't be seen. When the player is using cards from the hidden hand&#10;they will have to blindly play cards onto the discard pile to see if they are eligible. However, if a card fails to be suitable it will go into&#10;the general hand.&#10;&#10;Once all 3 of these hands have been emptied, the player wins the game.&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;There are also 3 special cards, 2s, 10s and 7s:&#10;&#10;- A 2 can be played on any card.&#10;- A 10 is the same as a 2 except it will also clear the discard pile and allow another card to be played.&#10;- A 7 when played, will force the other player to play a card that is lower or equal to a 7.&#10;&#10;Those are the regular rules of Shed but there are also a variety of game-modes that change the duration and rules of the game:&#10;&#10;- Basic Fast Track&#10;    Each player starts with 9 cards, 3 in each hand.&#10;    The draw pile is only used to deal cards at the start, and once the game starts, becomes empty&#10;    The player cannot stack cards, and can only play one card each turn (including 10's)&#10;    Player wins when they no longer have any cards in any hands&#10;&#10;- Basic&#10;    Each player starts with 9 cards, 3 in each hand.&#10;    The draw pile is drawn from by each player when they have less than 3 cards.&#10;        The draw pile is drawn from until it is empty.&#10;    The player cannot stack cards, and can only play one card each turn (including 10's)&#10;    Player wins when they no longer have any cards in any hands&#10;&#10;- Regular Fast Track&#10;    Each player starts with 9 cards, 3 in each hand.&#10;    The draw pile is drawn from by each player when they have less than 3 cards.&#10;        The draw pile is drawn from until it is empty.&#10;    The player can stack cards of the same value, stacking 4 of the same will result in an extra turn.&#10;    10's now also allow the player to play another card afterwards.&#10;    Player wins when they no longer have any cards in any hands.&#10;&#10;- Regular&#10;    Each player starts with 9 cards, 3 in each hand.&#10;    The draw pile is only used to deal cards at the start, and once the game starts, becomes empty&#10;    The player can stack cards of the same value, stacking 4 of the same will result in an extra turn.&#10;    10's now also allow the player to play another card afterwards.&#10;    Player wins when they no longer have any cards in any hands.&#10;&#10;Essentially, fast track will be a far shorter game and basic simplifies the rules for new players, by not allowing multiple cards&#10;being played or extra turns.&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Congrats on learning how to play Shed, hope you enjoy playing!">
